Press the red button to stop/allow default Firefox behavior for pop-up blocking.  

OKPopup was inspired by the original YesPopup by patheticcockroach.  I wrote OKPopup's code from scratch after seeing YesPopup getting taken down by its author.  The idea for controlling popups is patheticcockroach's, all credits go to him/her and developers of Mozilla Firefox :)

As this is my first addon (and my first jab at javascript stuff in general..) please let me know if there's anything weird, thank you.



NOTE: Before uninstalling please make sure the red button is not "pressed", or else normal pop-ups will not work.  To fix it just install the addon again and press button, make sure it's not "pressed", then uninstall as normal.
